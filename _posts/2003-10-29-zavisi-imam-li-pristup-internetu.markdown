Internet polako ali sigurno vodi u tom pravcu da knjige, pre svega štampana stručna literatura, jednostavno gube smisao. Sa [Kreblog-a](http://kreblog.com/posts/2749.aspx): "...I've never really been formally trained in what I do, and I've picked up most of my knowledge from books and just working on projects..." "...Now when I go on a interview, and they ask if I know techology X, I'll just ask, "That depends, I'll have Internet access right?"
