I needed to get only first and last line from a file (actually, not a file, but rather output from another command). `head -1` and `tail -1` can be used to get either first or last, but how to combine the two at the same time? Hereâ€™s how. Enter [`tee`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/tee):

    cat somefile | grep something | tee >(head -1) >(tail -1) > /dev/null

Neat, huh?
