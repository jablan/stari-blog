You have received a bunch of photos to you GMail account, and you want to publish them to your Picasa web album, but you hate having them downloaded to your machine, and then again uploaded to web, especially knowing that both Gmail and Picasa are Google’s applications. Wouldn’t it be nice if Gmail had an option to, besides download, upload the photos directly? Unfortunately, no such option.

There’s a workaround though. Go to your Picasa web account, go to photo settings page, there you will see an option to enable “email to Picasa”, by setting a special email account at @picasaweb.com. Just enable it, go to your Gmail, and simply forward your email with attached photos to newly created email address. You will get your photos imported to Picasa almost instantly.
