OK, here’s a joke which pretty well explains Serbian mentality.

Once there was a poor Serb, living in a village with his family and one scrawny cow. One day he catches a goldfish, and it promises three wishes if he lets it go.

First wish, he said, is for the first neighbor’s cow to die!

One snap of fins, neighbor’s cow dies.

Second wish, he goes on, let the cow of the other neighbor die…

So it does.

Last wish, asked the fish. Let my own cow die! said the man.

Why?! Everyone asked wondering.

So that those two, when they come to me to ask for some milk, I can say “fuck you, I don’t have any!”
