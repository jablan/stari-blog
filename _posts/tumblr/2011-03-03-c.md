These days I’m reading a great book titled [“Seven Languages in Seven Weeks”](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) by Bruce Tate, currently I’m on [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), and I am really surprised how easy it is to follow, knowing Ruby beforehand.

In chapter on lazy evaluation, I noticed couple of methods that didn’t have their exact counterparts in Ruby, and I was curious how hard would it be to implement them. So, there they are.

[`interpose`](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/1.2.0/clojure.core/interpose) works similarly to Ruby’s `join`, just more generic: its result is not String, but _lazy sequence_ of elements from the starting sequence, with object given as argument inserted in between each two.

Here it is, implemented in Ruby:

    module Enumerable
      def interpose obj
        Enumerator.new do |yielder|
          self.each_with_index do |elem, i|
            yielder.yield obj unless i == 0
            yielder.yield elem
          end
        end
      end
    end
    
    p [:lather, :rinse, :repeat].cycle.interpose(:and).take(5)
    #=> [:lather, :and, :rinse, :and, :repeat]

[`interleave`](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/interleave) works similarly to Ruby’s [`zip`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Enumerable.html#M001517), but this one also works on lazy sequences, not Arrays, as in Ruby, meaning that you can apply it to indefinite sequences as well. Here it is in Ruby:

    module Enumerable
      def interleave another
        this = self.to_enum
        another = another.to_enum
        Enumerator.new do |yielder|
          loop do
            yielder.yield this.next
            yielder.yield another.next
          end
        end
      end
    end
    
    p (0...2).cycle.interleave((0...3).cycle).take(20)
    #=> [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]

Both examples are taken directly from Bruce Tate’s book.
